## Input Artifacts v1

Here's how you can include **Input Artifacts** in your SOW under the "Inputs" section:

---

### **2.1 Input Artifacts**

The Data Migration Design Team will require the following items from the **EOC/ECM Solution Design Team** to ensure alignment with the migration objectives and the design specifications:

- **ECM Catalog LLD Template** (refer to reference [4]):
   - This document is crucial for identifying impacted End-to-End (E2E) attributes, specifically noting if they are mandatory, their source system (generator), and their target systems (consumers).
   - Particular attention should be paid to the E2E attribute worksheet, ensuring that attributes are correctly mapped and handled during migration.

- **Mapping of Legacy to Target Products (AS-IS / TO-BE)**:
   - This document provides a comprehensive mapping between legacy system products and their corresponding target system products in the new Ericsson Billing 24 platform.
   - It is essential for identifying any gaps, customizations, or changes between the current system and the future state.

These documents, provided by the **EOC/ECM Solution Design Team**, are critical for the Data Migration Design Team and SR Migration Teams to:
- Maintain alignment on system requirements and customizations.
- Ensure that all system attributes are accounted for, reducing the risk of missing undocumented characteristics.
