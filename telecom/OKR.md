# Objectives and key results (OKR, alternatively OKRs)

Based on common business frameworks, **OKR** stands for **Objectives and Key Results**.

It is a powerful goal-setting framework used by individuals, teams, and organizations to define ambitious goals and track their outcomes effectively.

The framework is composed of two main elements:

### 1. Objectives (O)
* **What you want to achieve.**
* These are **clear, inspirational, and qualitative** goals that describe the desired future state.
* *Example:* "Deliver a world-class customer experience."

### 2. Key Results (KR)
* **How you will measure progress toward the Objective.**
* These are **specific, measurable, time-bound, and quantitative** metrics. They are indicators that let you know if you have successfully achieved your Objective.
* *Example for the Objective above:* "Increase our Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) score from 85% to 92%." or "Reduce average customer response time from 3 hours to under 1 hour."

### Summary
The OKR system helps promote **alignment** (ensuring everyone is working toward the same strategic priorities), **transparency** (goals are public), and **focus** on the most important initiatives within an organization. It is famously used by companies like Google and Intel.
