# Operations Support Systems (OSS)

Operations Support Systems (OSS) are information technology systems that support and enable the day-to-day operations of a telecommunications or other service provider. OSS typically include a range of systems and tools that are used to manage the network infrastructure, customer service, billing, and other operational functions of the service provider.

OSS can include a wide variety of systems and applications, such as network inventory and configuration management systems, performance monitoring and management systems, and customer service and support systems. These systems are designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the service provider's operations, and to provide a high level of service to customers.

In addition to supporting internal operations, OSS may also be used to interface with other systems and partners, such as supply chain systems and wholesale partners. This allows the service provider to exchange information and coordinate activities with other organizations in a seamless and efficient manner.

Overall, OSS play a critical role in the operations of service providers, and are essential for the delivery of high-quality services to customers.

## network inventory

A network inventory is a record of all the hardware and software components that make up a computer network. This can include a wide range of items, such as servers, routers, switches, firewalls, and other network devices, as well as the software and applications that run on these devices.

A network inventory is an important tool for network administrators, as it provides a detailed and up-to-date record of the components that make up the network. This information is useful for a variety of purposes, including network planning and design, asset management, and problem diagnosis and resolution.

In order to create and maintain a network inventory, administrators can use a variety of tools and techniques, such as network scanning and discovery tools, manual data entry, and asset tracking software. These tools can help administrators to identify and catalog all of the devices and software on the network, as well as keep track of their configurations and status.

Overall, a well-maintained network inventory is an essential component of effective network management, and can help administrators to more efficiently and effectively manage their network resources.
