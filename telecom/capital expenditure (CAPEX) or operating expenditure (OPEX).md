# Capital expenditure (CAPEX) or operating expenditure (OPEX)

In accounting, telecommunications spend can be classified either as capital expenditure (CAPEX) or operating expenditure (OPEX) based on the nature and duration of the expense. Here are the general guidelines for determining how to classify telecommunications expenses:

### Capital Expenditure (CAPEX)
Telecommunications spend should be considered as CAPEX when the expense is associated with acquiring, upgrading, or extending the life of a long-term asset. These are typically one-time or infrequent expenditures that provide benefits over a prolonged period (usually more than one year). Examples include:

- **Purchasing Telecommunications Equipment**: Buying routers, switches, servers, and other hardware.
- **Infrastructure Development**: Installing or upgrading fiber optic cables, network infrastructure, and other physical installations.
- **Significant Upgrades**: Major upgrades or expansions to existing telecommunications systems that significantly enhance their capabilities or extend their useful life.
- **Software and Licensing**: Acquisition of telecommunications software and licenses that are not renewed annually but have a long-term usage period.

CAPEX is capitalized on the balance sheet and depreciated over the asset's useful life.

### Operating Expenditure (OPEX)
Telecommunications spend should be considered as OPEX when the expense is part of the daily operations and maintenance of the business. These costs are recurring and directly related to the operational needs of the company. Examples include:

- **Service Contracts**: Monthly or annual fees for internet, phone, and other communication services.
- **Maintenance and Repairs**: Costs for maintaining and repairing telecommunications equipment and infrastructure.
- **Subscription Fees**: Regular payments for cloud-based communication services, software-as-a-service (SaaS) subscriptions, and other recurring costs.
- **Utilities**: Costs associated with telecommunications services used in day-to-day operations.

OPEX is expensed on the income statement in the period in which it is incurred.

### Decision Criteria
To decide whether telecommunications spend should be classified as CAPEX or OPEX, consider the following:

- **Duration of Benefit**: If the expense provides benefits for more than one year, it is likely CAPEX. If it is consumed within a year, it is OPEX.
- **Nature of Expense**: Assess whether the spend is for acquiring or improving long-term assets (CAPEX) versus maintaining day-to-day operations (OPEX).
- **Accounting Policies**: Adhere to the company's accounting policies and guidelines, which might provide specific thresholds and criteria for classification.
- **Financial Strategy**: Consider the financial strategy and impact on financial statements. CAPEX affects the balance sheet and depreciation schedules, while OPEX impacts the current income statement.

Correct classification ensures accurate financial reporting and can have significant implications for a company's tax liability and financial planning.

## How much OPEX could telco operators save with fully automated service operations using network slicing?

The potential savings in operating expenditures (OPEX) for telco operators with fully automated service operations using network slicing can be significant, although the exact amount can vary based on several factors such as the size of the operator, the extent of current automation, and specific implementation details. Here’s a general overview of the impact and potential savings:

### Potential OPEX Savings with Network Slicing and Automation

1. **Improved Efficiency**:
   - **Resource Utilization**: Network slicing allows operators to efficiently allocate and manage network resources by creating virtualized, isolated network segments tailored to specific use cases or services. This can lead to better utilization of infrastructure and reduced wastage.
   - **Automated Management**: Automation in service operations reduces the need for manual interventions, which can significantly cut down labor costs associated with network management, maintenance, and service provisioning.

2. **Reduction in Operational Costs**:
   - **Dynamic Resource Allocation**: Automated systems can dynamically allocate resources based on real-time demand, reducing the need for over-provisioning and thereby lowering costs associated with underutilized assets.
   - **Predictive Maintenance**: Automation, coupled with AI and machine learning, enables predictive maintenance, which can prevent costly network downtimes and repairs by addressing issues before they escalate.

3. **Service Agility and Scalability**:
   - **Faster Service Deployment**: Network slicing allows for quicker deployment of new services, which reduces the time-to-market and operational costs associated with traditional, slower deployment methods.
   - **Scalable Operations**: As demand changes, automated systems can scale operations up or down seamlessly without significant manual intervention, ensuring optimal cost management.

4. **Enhanced Customer Experience**:
   - **Self-Healing Networks**: Automated, intelligent networks can self-diagnose and self-heal, reducing the frequency and duration of service outages, which translates to lower operational costs and improved customer satisfaction.
   - **Tailored Services**: With network slicing, operators can offer customized services for different customer segments efficiently, potentially increasing revenue while keeping operational costs low.

### Quantifying Savings
While the exact percentage of OPEX savings varies, several industry estimates provide a ballpark figure:

- **Ericsson**: Studies suggest that network slicing combined with automation can lead to OPEX reductions of up to 30-40% in certain scenarios.
- **Analysys Mason**: Their research indicates that automation and network slicing can reduce OPEX by 20-25% on average for operators who fully implement these technologies.
- **Nokia**: Their analyses estimate potential OPEX savings of around 20-30% through the use of automated network slicing.

### Conclusion
The potential OPEX savings from fully automated service operations using network slicing are substantial, often cited in the range of 20-40%. These savings come from improved resource utilization, reduced manual labor, efficient maintenance, and quicker, more flexible service provisioning. However, achieving these savings requires significant upfront investment in automation technologies, robust implementation strategies, and a clear understanding of the operator’s specific operational dynamics.
