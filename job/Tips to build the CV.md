I reviewed 300+ resumes this month.

This one stood out from the rest.

I always share it with my coaching clients and friends.

And they're landing interviews and offers at companies like Google, OpenAI, and Stripe.

For roles paying $100K-400K.

I got the template from Teal's AI Resume Builder.

It's a simple template, nothing fancy.

But here's why it works:

1) Simple design & formatting

Easy to read but also 'ATS-friendly' so you won't run into readability issues when you're applying to jobs and uploading your resume.

2) Strong summary

Instead of jargon or an 'objective statement' they share a summary with/ highlights from their career. It's the first thing someone reads and can help get their attention.

3) Achievements > Responsibilities

They clearly articulate what they've accomplished instead of just listing out their job responsibilities.

4) Measurable Impact

Results and numbers are included for each job. People can easily understand what kind of impact they've had on the business.

5) Relevant Keywords & Skills

The right keywords are embedded in their bullet points to demonstrate how they used those skills. A skills section is also included for easy reference.

I work with many recruiters and hiring managers.
They also appreciate seeing these things on a resume.

Don't underestimate the power of a well-crafted resume.

Use this template and best practices to stand out among the competition.
