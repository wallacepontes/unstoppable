# Annual salary of $150,000

## Annual salary of $150,000

To determine the hourly pay based on an annual salary of $150,000, we need to make some assumptions about the number of hours worked per year. A common assumption is that there are 2,080 working hours in a year (40 hours per week for 52 weeks). Here's the calculation:

\[ \text{Hourly Pay} = \frac{\text{Annual Salary}}{\text{Number of Working Hours per Year}} \]

\[ \text{Hourly Pay} = \frac{150,000}{2,080} \]

Let's calculate that.

\[ \text{Hourly Pay} = \frac{150,000}{2,080} \approx 72.12 \]

So, the hourly pay for an annual salary of $150,000 is approximately $72.12.

## For a daily rate of $500

For a daily rate of $500, the annual salary can be calculated using the same formula:

\[ \text{Annual Salary} = \text{Daily Rate} \times 5 \times 52 \]

\[ \text{Annual Salary} = 500 \times 5 \times 52 \]

Let me calculate that:

\[ \text{Annual Salary} = 500 \times 260 = 130,000 \]

So, for a daily rate of $500, the annual salary would be **$130,000**.
