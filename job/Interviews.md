# Interviews

## 7 things you need to AVOID saying in job interviews at all costs:

✋🏿1. Saying bad things about your old job.

* 🟢You had a good boss.
* 🟢You liked your workplace.
* 🟢You liked the office.
* 🟢You liked your job.

✋🏿Why are you quitting?

* 🟢To move forward.
* 🟢It's that simple.

✋🏿2. I excel at what I do. Don't tell them; show them:

* 🟢I have stories that highlight my skills.
* 🟢I can provide examples of my work.
* 🟢I've gained valuable experiences that have honed my abilities.
* 🟢My results speak for themselves.
* 🟢I've received recognition and awards for my achievements.

💯Actions speak louder than words. Let me demonstrate my capabilities through my track record and accomplishments.

✋🏿3. My weakness?

* 🟢Well, I believe in being honest and realistic. While I wouldn't say I'm a perfectionist, I have had challenges with time management in the past.
* 🟢However, I've learned to prioritize tasks effectively and delegate when necessary to ensure deadlines are met.
* 🟢I've also implemented time management techniques such as setting clear goals and breaking tasks into smaller, manageable steps.
* 🟢This has helped me become more efficient and productive in my work.

✋🏿4. Discussing your current salary at this stage can limit your potential earnings:

* 🟢It's best to avoid sharing this information.
* 🟢Additionally, your current salary may not accurately reflect the value you bring to the new role.
* 🟢Therefore, it's preferable to focus on discussing your skills, experiences, and the value you can add to the new position rather than your current salary.

✋🏿5. I know I don't have much experience, but I've been called for an interview.

* 🟢I do have enough experience.
* 🟢Don't qualify yourself out or introduce any doubt.
* 🟢If you doubt yourself, so will others.

✋🏿6. "I'm ready to start on Monday."

* 🟢This suggests that you don't feel valued at your current job. 
* 🟢It also means you can't negotiate the start date. Employers usually expect you to give notice before leaving, so don't let your excitement make you forget that.

✋🏿7. "I don't know how to do that." 

* 🟢"I have no idea."
* 🟢Pause and consider what you do know. 
* 🟢"I haven't done that exactly as you described, but in my current job, I...
* 🟢" Then, elaborate on a similar task or experience you've had.
