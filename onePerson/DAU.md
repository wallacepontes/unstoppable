# DAU

Daily Active Users, or DAU, is the measurement of the number of users who are active on an app or website each day. It is a tool used to measure the success of an online product or website. The higher the DAU, the more “sticky” or successful a website or product is viewed

DAU, or Daily Active Users, refers to the total number of unique users who engage with an app, website, or online service within a 24-hour period. It is a key metric for assessing user engagement and the "stickiness" of a digital product. A high DAU indicates that users are consistently returning to the platform, which often correlates with the platform's success in retaining and satisfying its user base. Companies use DAU to track growth, user behavior, and the effectiveness of marketing or product updates.
