# IR35 regulations

## What is an example of outside IR35?

An example of a contractor operating outside IR35 could be a self-employed IT consultant working for multiple clients on a project-by-project basis. Here's a detailed scenario illustrating this:

### Scenario: IT Consultant Outside IR35

**Contractor:** Jane Doe, an IT consultant with her own limited company, JD Tech Solutions Ltd.

**Client:** Tech Innovations Corp.

#### Contract Details:
1. **Control:**
   - Jane has significant control over how she performs her work. She decides on the tools and methods to use without direct supervision from Tech Innovations Corp.
   - She sets her own hours and often works remotely.

2. **Substitution:**
   - Jane's contract allows her to send a qualified substitute to perform the work if she is unavailable. This indicates she is not personally required to perform the services, which is a key IR35 determinant.

3. **Mutuality of Obligation (MOO):**
   - Tech Innovations Corp. is not obligated to provide continuous work beyond the current project, and Jane is not obligated to accept additional work from Tech Innovations Corp. once the project is completed.

4. **Financial Risk:**
   - Jane incurs her own business expenses, such as purchasing equipment and software licenses.
   - She invoices Tech Innovations Corp. for her services and does not receive employee benefits like sick pay or holiday pay.

5. **Provision of Equipment:**
   - Jane provides her own laptop, software, and other tools needed for the job.

6. **Part and Parcel:**
   - Jane is not integrated into Tech Innovations Corp.â€™s internal structure. She does not have a permanent desk or phone extension, and she does not attend internal staff meetings or receive employee perks.

### Result:
Given these factors, Jane's working arrangement with Tech Innovations Corp. would likely be considered outside IR35. The contract clearly delineates her as an independent contractor rather than an employee, reflecting a genuine business-to-business relationship. This allows Jane to continue benefiting from the tax efficiencies of operating through her limited company.

## Only at England is it available?

IR35 regulations are specific to the United Kingdom, so the concept of being inside or outside IR35 applies only to contractors working within the UK. This includes England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. 

Other countries have their own rules and regulations regarding employment status, self-employment, and taxation for contractors. For example:

- **United States:** Contractors must adhere to guidelines set by the IRS to determine if they are independent contractors or employees. The IRS uses various tests, including behavioral control, financial control, and the relationship of the parties, to make this determination.

- **Australia:** The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) uses the "contractor vs. employee" test, which assesses factors like control, the basis of payment, and the ability to delegate tasks.

- **Canada:** The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) evaluates the nature of the working relationship through tests similar to those used by the IRS, focusing on control, ownership of tools, the chance of profit, and the risk of loss.

- **European Union:** Individual EU countries have their own regulations, although there are some common guidelines under EU labor laws that distinguish between employed and self-employed status.

So, while the specifics of IR35 are unique to the UK, other countries have analogous regulations to determine the employment status and tax obligations of contractors.
