# Ronald Reagan and Joe Biden

## "How good it's going to be"

The phrase "How good it's going to be" is often used by politicians, including Democrats, to convey optimism and confidence about future policies, initiatives, or changes they are proposing or implementing. It aims to inspire hope and positive expectations among constituents, suggesting that the proposed measures will bring beneficial outcomes.

If Democrats are currently using this phrase frequently, it could be in relation to specific legislative achievements, upcoming elections, economic improvements, or other key issues where they believe positive changes are imminent. This kind of rhetoric is common in political discourse to build support and maintain a positive public image.

## Ronan Reagan had a joke about it

Ronald Reagan was known for his wit and humor, and he often used jokes to make political points. One of his famous jokes about Democrats goes like this:

"A recession is when your neighbor loses his job. A depression is when you lose yours. And recovery is when Jimmy Carter loses his."

This joke plays on economic terms to criticize the then-Democratic President Jimmy Carter and to highlight Reagan's own plans for economic recovery. While this specific joke doesn't use the exact phrase "How good it's going to be," it captures Reagan's style of humor and his approach to critiquing his political opponents.

## A depression is when you lose yours

A recession is when your neighbor loses his job. A depression is when you lose yours. And recovery is when Joe Biden loses his.

This updated version of Ronald Reagan's joke swaps out Jimmy Carter for Joe Biden, reflecting current political sentiments. It follows the same structure, using economic terms to critique the sitting president, in this case, Joe Biden, and suggests that economic recovery is tied to a change in leadership. This kind of humor is often used in political discourse to make a point in a light-hearted way while still conveying a critical message.
