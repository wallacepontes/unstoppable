# Dad's Wisdom Journey

This reflection humorously captures the evolving perception of a father’s wisdom as a person matures. It’s a poignant reminder of how our views change with experience and understanding. Here’s a similar take:

5 years old - My dad knows everything! 

7 years old - My dad knows a lot. 

10 years old - Maybe my dad doesn’t know everything? 

12 years old - My dad doesn’t know much. 

14 years old - My dad is so out of touch! 

16 years old - I can’t take my dad seriously. 

18 years old - My dad doesn’t know anything. 

22 years old - My dad is clueless. 

24 years old - I know more than my dad! 

26 years old - Maybe my dad knows some things after all. 

30 years old - I should ask my dad about this. 

40 years old - It’s incredible how my dad managed everything! 

45 years old - My dad was right all along. 

50 years old - I wish my dad was here; I could have learned so much…
