# Onboarding

If it takes 6 months for a developer to become productive in a new role, something is wrong.

And it needs fixing.

Any developer joining a new team should be making a commit within the first day or two, certainly within the first week.

If they’re not able to do that, there is something wrong with your onboarding - fix it!

After that first week they should be up and ready to start making regular contributions. Sure they might not be ready to tackle the most complex issues your team works on, but they should be in a position to start contributing.

If they’re not able to do that, there is something wrong with your onboarding - fix it!

Beyond that anyone with a few years of relevant experience, should be productive well within the first month. If they’re not, they might not be a good fit for the team, or there might be issues that need to be addressed within the team - fix them!

In my career, I’ve jumped into new code bases and projects regularly, sometimes even in tech stacks or programming languages that I don’t know. Meanwhile, I’ve had clients and managers expecting results - FAST.

Many of those projects have been very short. The shortest was 4 hours! Many were under two weeks long, I had to be productive fast, so I know it can be done.

The secret to doing this as a developer is to use the techniques that you use to debug a system to learn a new one.

## How long do you think a developer needs to become productive in a new role?

The timeframe for a developer to become productive in a new role can vary depending on several factors, including the complexity of the project, the developer's prior experience and skills, the effectiveness of the onboarding process, and the support provided by the team. 

In the statement you provided, there's a strong emphasis on rapid integration and contribution, suggesting that developers should ideally become productive within days to weeks, rather than months. This is a reasonable expectation in many cases, especially for experienced developers who are familiar with similar technologies and have strong problem-solving skills.

However, it's essential to recognize that every developer and every project is unique. Some projects may require more time for onboarding due to their complexity or specialized requirements. Additionally, inexperienced developers or those new to a particular technology stack may need more time to ramp up and become fully productive.

Ultimately, the goal should be to optimize the onboarding process and provide adequate support to help developers integrate quickly while also ensuring they have the necessary understanding and resources to contribute effectively to the project. If onboarding processes consistently take longer than expected, it's essential to evaluate and improve them to better support new team members and ensure the overall success of the team and the project.
