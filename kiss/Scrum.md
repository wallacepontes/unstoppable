## Scrum is a cancer.

I've been writing software for 25 years, and nothing renders a software team useless like Scrum does.

Some anecdotes:

1. They tried to convince me that Poker is a planning tool, not a game.

2. If you want to be more efficient, you must add process, not remove it. They had us attending the "ceremonies," a fancy name for a buttload of meetings: stand-ups, groomings, planning, retrospectives, and Scrum of Scrums. We spent more time talking than doing.

3. We prohibited laptops in meetings. We had to stand. We passed a ball around to keep everyone paying attention. 

4. We spent more time estimating story points than writing software. Story points measure complexity, not time, but we had to decide how many story points fit in a sprint.

5. I had to use t-shirt sizes to estimate software.

6. We measured how much it cost to deliver one story point and then wrote contracts where clients paid for a package of "500 story points."

7. Management lost it when they found that 500 story points in one project weren't the same as 500 story points on another project. We had many meetings to fix this.

8. Imagine having a manager, a scrum master, a product owner, and a tech lead. You had to answer to all of them and none simultaneously.
 
9. We paid people who told us whether we were "burning down points" fast enough. Weren't story points about complexity instead of time? Never mind.

I believe in Agile, but this ain't agile.

We brought professional Scrum trainers. We paid people from our team to get certified. We tried Scrum this way and that other way. We spent years doing it.

The result was always the same: It didn't work.

Scrum is a cancer that will eat your development team. Scrum is not for developers; it's another tool for managers to feel they are in control.

But the best about Scrum are those who look you in the eye and tell you: "If it doesn't work for you, you are doing it wrong. Scrum is anything that works for your team."

Sure it is.


### few points to consider

It sounds like you've had a very frustrating experience with Scrum, and I can understand your perspective. Scrum, like any methodology or framework, is not a one-size-fits-all solution, and it can be implemented poorly, leading to negative outcomes. It's important to remember that the success or failure of Scrum often depends on how it is implemented and adapted to the specific needs and culture of a team or organization.

Here are a few points to consider:

1. **Implementation Matters:** The problems you've mentioned, such as excessive meetings, rigid adherence to story points, and misunderstandings about the purpose of Scrum, are not inherent flaws of Scrum itself but rather how it was implemented in your context. Scrum should be adapted to suit the needs of the team, not imposed blindly.

2. **Flexibility is Key:** Agile principles, including Scrum, emphasize adaptability and continuous improvement. If a specific aspect of Scrum is not working for a team, it should be examined and adjusted. It's crucial to be open to change and experimentation.

3. **Scrum Masters Play a Vital Role:** A skilled Scrum Master should help the team understand the principles behind Scrum and guide them towards effective implementation. If you had a Scrum Master who focused too much on rigid processes or didn't address your team's concerns, it could have contributed to your negative experience.

4. **Team Empowerment:** Agile methodologies are supposed to empower teams to make decisions and take ownership of their work. If you felt micromanaged or controlled by management, it's a sign that the Agile principles were not being followed properly.

5. **Not One-Size-Fits-All:** Scrum is not the only Agile methodology available. Depending on your team's needs and circumstances, another Agile framework or a hybrid approach might work better.

It's unfortunate that you had a negative experience with Scrum, but it's essential to recognize that many teams have had success with it when implemented thoughtfully and flexibly. Agile methodologies should be tools that empower teams to deliver value efficiently, not processes that hinder productivity. If you are still interested in Agile, it might be worth exploring alternative approaches or revisiting Scrum with a more adaptable mindset and a focus on the Agile principles rather than strict adherence to ceremonies.
