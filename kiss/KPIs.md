# KPIs

I think reframing KPIs from "Key Performance Indicators" to something like "Keep People Involved/Informed/Interested/Inspired" adds a human-centric approach to performance measurement. It shifts the focus from pure metrics to engagement and motivation, making it more about the people and less about rigid numbers.

This perspective can foster a more inclusive work culture, encouraging ongoing involvement, transparency, and enthusiasm. Itâ€™s also a reminder that performance is not just about outcomes, but about ensuring that the people driving those outcomes feel connected to the mission and goals.

## Do you think this shift would align with the projects you're working on, especially in terms of keeping your teams or stakeholders more engaged?

It sounds like you had a solid, structured experience with traditional KPIs, focusing on measurable outcomes like efficiency, effectiveness, and efficacy. Shifting to a more people-centric approach might feel different, but it could offer additional value by enhancing team engagement and motivation beyond just numbers.

With your experience, you could balance both approaches: using traditional KPIs to measure quantitative aspects while integrating this new idea to keep people inspired and engaged. This blend could help foster a well-rounded performance culture that values both outcomes and the team's well-being. Would that resonate with your approach?

## Balance efficiency with effectiveness

Efficiency refers to the ability to perform a task using the available resources in the best possible way, minimizing waste of time, money and effort. On the other hand, effectiveness refers to the ability to achieve the proposed objectives, that is, whether the results achieved are in line with the goals and expectations.

Sometimes, you may try very hard to be efficient in an activity, but if that activity is not aligned with the larger goals or if it does not produce the desired results, then that efficiency may be in vain. Therefore, it is important to balance efficiency with effectiveness, ensuring that efforts are directed to the right areas and that the results meet the specific purposes.
