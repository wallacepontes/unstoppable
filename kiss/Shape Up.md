## 🧭 What Is Shape Up?

**Shape Up*- is a **product development framework*- introduced by Ryan Singer from Basecamp.
Unlike Scrum, which focuses on sprints, backlogs, and ceremonies, Shape Up emphasizes:

- Clear **problem definition*- before development starts.
- Fixed **time cycles (6 weeks)*- but **flexible scope**.
- Small, autonomous teams that **ship finished work**, not endless iterations.
- No backlogs or story points — **you either bet on a project or not**.

---

## ⚙️ The Core Concepts of Shape Up

Shape Up revolves around **three phases**:

### 1. **Shaping (before development)**

- **Goal:*- Define the problem and sketch a solution that’s “shaped” enough to start work — but not over-specified.
- Done by senior product people (like a product manager or designer) *before- the cycle starts.
- Outputs a **pitch**, not a backlog item.
**Shaping includes:**

- Defining the **problem*- clearly.
- Setting **boundaries*- (what’s in/out of scope).
- Sketching **core elements*- of a possible solution.
- Defining the **appetite**: how much time (and effort) the team is willing to spend (e.g., 6 weeks).
- Identifying **risks and rabbit holes*- early.

📄 Example Pitch:

```text
Pitch: Add bulk delete to project dashboard
Problem: Users struggle to clean up old projects individually.
Appetite: 2 weeks
Solution: Add multi-select + delete button with confirmation.
Risks: Handling dependencies and user permissions.
```

---

### 2. **Betting (planning what to build)**

- Instead of a **backlog grooming meeting**, you have a **betting table*- every cycle.
- Stakeholders review **shaped pitches*- and decide **which ones to bet on*- for the next 6-week cycle.
- If a pitch isn’t selected, it **doesn’t go into a backlog*- — it’s discarded or reshaped later.

This keeps the team **focused only on what’s actively important**, avoiding backlog bloat.

---

### 3. **Building (execution)**

- Teams of 2–3 people (a designer + 1–2 developers) work independently for 6 weeks.
- No daily standups or sprint planning.
- They own the problem and decide how to deliver the shaped solution within the fixed time.

💡 **Fixed time, variable scope:**
If time runs short, scope is trimmed, not deadlines extended.

At the end of 6 weeks:

- The project ships or is considered done.
- A 2-week **cool-down period*- follows, for maintenance, bug fixes, or shaping new ideas.

## 🧩 Shape Up vs Scrum

| Concept           | Scrum                                   | Shape Up                                |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Cycle Length*-  | 1–2 week sprints                        | 6-week cycles                           |
| **Planning*-      | Backlog grooming & sprint planning      | Betting table (pitches)                 |
| **Roles*-         | Product Owner, Scrum Master, Developers | Small autonomous teams                  |
| **Artifacts*-     | Backlog, sprint board, stories          | Pitches, cycles                         |
| **Scope vs Time*- | Fixed scope, flexible time              | Fixed time, flexible scope              |
| **Meetings*-      | Daily standups, retrospectives          | Minimal; async updates preferred        |
| **Output*-        | Incremental features                    | Fully shipped projects                  |
| **Backlog*-       | Central backlog of items                | No backlog — only shaped, pitched ideas |

👉 **In short:*- Shape Up eliminates the overhead of Scrum while keeping discipline through shaping and timeboxing.

## 🚀 Getting Started With Shape Up (Step-by-Step)

Here’s a simple path to introduce Shape Up in your org or team:

### Step 1: Learn the Core Framework

Read [the official Shape Up book (free by Basecamp)](https://basecamp.com/shapeup).

### Step 2: Define Your Cycle

- Decide your **cycle length*- (commonly 6 weeks + 2 weeks cooldown).
- Determine your **team structure*- (e.g., 2 devs + 1 designer).

### Step 3: Start Shaping

- Identify **pain points or opportunities**.
- Write **pitches*- instead of backlog tickets.
- Limit shaping to 2–3 solid ideas per cycle.

### Step 4: Run Your First Betting Table

- Gather stakeholders (PMs, tech leads, leadership).
- Choose which pitches to **bet on*- for the next cycle.
- Assign teams and clarify expectations.

### Step 5: Build

- Let teams **self-manage*- their work.
- Track progress using Hill Charts (Basecamp’s metaphor for “unknowns vs knowns”).
- Keep communication **async**, focusing on demo-ready outcomes.

### Step 6: Cool Down

- After each 6-week cycle:

  - Fix bugs or small issues.
  - Reflect, improve, and shape new ideas.

## ⚖️ Is Shape Up a Good Alternative to Scrum?

✅ **When Shape Up works best:**

- Small to medium-sized product teams.
- Companies tired of Scrum’s overhead.
- Teams with experienced developers and designers capable of self-direction.
- Environments where delivering outcomes matters more than velocity metrics.

⚠️ **When Scrum may still be better:**

- Large organizations with strict coordination needs.
- Teams that require close guidance or have immature development processes.
- Projects where incremental delivery every 1–2 weeks is mandatory (e.g., regulated industries).

---

## 🧠 Pro Tips

- Don’t try to **mix Scrum and Shape Up*- — pick one mindset.
- Shape Up thrives on **trust*- and **autonomy*- — micromanagement breaks it.
- Start small — pilot with one team for one cycle.
- Use **lightweight tools*- like Basecamp, Linear, or Notion instead of Jira.
