# 🚀 **ITIL 4 – Getting Started Tutorial**

## 📌 **1. What Is ITIL 4?**

ITIL 4 (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) is a **framework of best practices for managing IT services**.
Its goal: help organizations **deliver value** to customers by combining **people + processes + technology**.

ITIL 4 is more modern than previous versions because it:

* Integrates **Agile, DevOps, Lean**
* Focuses on **co-creation of value**, not just delivering services
* Encourages flexibility instead of rigid processes

# 📚 **2. ITIL 4 Key Concepts (The Foundations)**

## **2.1 The Four Dimensions of Service Management**

Think of these as the "four lenses" required to deliver good services:

1. **Organizations and People**
2. **Information and Technology**
3. **Partners and Suppliers**
4. **Value Streams and Processes**

You ALWAYS analyze services using these dimensions.

## **2.2 The ITIL Service Value System (SVS)**

The SVS is the core of ITIL 4. It explains how an organization transforms demand into value.

The SVS includes:

* **Guiding Principles**
* **Governance**
* **Service Value Chain**
* **Practices**
* **Continuous Improvement**

## **2.3 The Seven Guiding Principles**

These are universal rules for decision-making:

1. **Focus on value**
2. **Start where you are**
3. **Progress iteratively with feedback**
4. **Collaborate and promote visibility**
5. **Think and work holistically**
6. **Keep it simple and practical**
7. **Optimize and automate**

These principles are ESSENTIAL for applying ITIL effectively.

# 🏭 **3. The Service Value Chain (SVC)**

This is the engine of ITIL 4 — how we deliver services.

It has **6 activities**:

1. **Plan**
2. **Improve**
3. **Engage**
4. **Design & Transition**
5. **Obtain/Build**
6. **Deliver & Support**

Everything your organization does flows through these activities.

Example value stream for handling an incident:

* Engage → Deliver & Support → Improve
