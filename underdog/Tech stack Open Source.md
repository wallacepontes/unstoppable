# Teck Stack Open Source

This stack looks more **enterprise-style**, with higher recurring costs compared to the leaner one you listed earlier. Let’s break it down:

---

### 📦 Stack Overview

1. **Frontend – Next.js (Free)**
   Same as before, reliable, proven.

2. **Language – TypeScript (Free)**
   Standard for modern fullstack development.

3. **AI IDE – Cursor.ai (\$200/month)**
   Premium developer productivity. This is optional unless your team heavily relies on AI pair-programming.

4. **Code Hosting – GitHub (\$21/user/month)**
   Cost grows with team size. Needed if you want private repos, actions, CI/CD.

5. **Website Hosting – Vercel (\$90/month)**
   Optimized for Next.js, but more expensive than Hetzner/Coolify.

6. **Database – PlanetScale (\$200/month)**
   MySQL-based serverless DB, highly scalable. But costlier than Supabase.

7. **Background Jobs – Trigger.dev (\$50/month)**
   Useful for queues, cron jobs, workflows. Supabase + serverless functions could replace this early on.

8. **Emails – Resend.com (\$20/month)**
   Solid transactional email provider. Similar to Bento but without marketing automation.

9. **Payments – Stripe (3% of revenue)**
   Industry standard, widely trusted. Slightly higher fees than Polar but safer for global SaaS.

### ⚖️ Pros vs Cons

✅ **Pros**

* Very **developer-friendly**: GitHub + Vercel + PlanetScale integrate seamlessly.
* **High scalability**: This setup won’t break as you grow.
* **Industry standard tools**: Easy to hire devs familiar with this stack.

⚠️ **Cons**

* **High baseline cost**:

  * \~ \$581/month fixed (before Stripe % fees).
  * Much higher than your first stack (\~\$85–100/month).
* **Vendor lock-in**: Vercel + PlanetScale = less flexibility compared to Hetzner + Supabase.
* **Overkill for MVP**: This setup is better if you already have traction/users.

### 💰 Cost Comparison

* **Your first stack**: \~ **\$85–100/month**
* **This second stack**: \~ **\$581/month + 3% of revenue**

---

👉 I’d say:

* **Go with your first stack** if you’re validating an MVP or early SaaS.
* **Upgrade to this second stack** once you hit scale (thousands of users, revenue to offset costs).

Do you want me to put **both stacks side by side in a comparison table** so you can quickly decide which fits your stage best?
