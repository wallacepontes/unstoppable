# Hacker News - Indie Hackers - Lobste.rs

## Hacker News

Hacker News (HN) is a social news website focused on technology, startups, programming, and entrepreneurship. It was created in 2007 by Paul Graham as part of Y Combinator, a startup accelerator. The platform allows users to submit links to articles, blog posts, or other content, which the community then votes on to determine visibility on the site’s front page. Users can also submit "Ask HN" posts for discussions or questions and "Show HN" posts to showcase projects.

Key features:
- **Content**: Emphasizes tech-related topics like coding, AI, startups, and computer science, but also covers broader subjects like science and culture.
- **Community**: Known for its engaged, often highly technical user base, including developers, entrepreneurs, and investors. Discussions are typically thoughtful but can be critical or contrarian.
- **Moderation**: Minimal but present, with guidelines discouraging low-effort comments, trolling, or off-topic posts. Moderators may adjust rankings to maintain quality.
- **Ranking System**: Uses an algorithm based on upvotes, time since posting, and flags to rank stories. Controversial or heavily flagged posts may be penalized.
- **No Ads**: The site remains ad-free, relying on simplicity and community-driven content.

HN is influential in tech circles, often driving significant traffic to linked articles and shaping discussions in the industry. It’s accessible at news.ycombinator.com, and its minimalist design prioritizes content over flashiness. Posts on X describe it as a go-to for staying updated on tech trends, though some note its niche focus and occasionally intense debates.

## Indie Hackers

**Indie Hackers** is a vibrant online community and resource hub for independent entrepreneurs, known as "indie hackers," who build and grow profitable online businesses, typically without external funding like venture capital. Founded in 2016 by Courtland Allen and later acquired by Stripe, it’s a platform where solo founders and small teams share stories, strategies, and revenue figures to inspire and educate others. It’s particularly popular among developers, designers, and creators who value autonomy and bootstrapping.

### Key Features of Indie Hackers:
- **Community Forum**: A space for founders to discuss challenges, share successes, and seek advice. Topics range from product development to marketing and monetization.
- **Interviews and Case Studies**: Detailed stories from indie hackers about their journeys, including revenue numbers and lessons learned, fostering transparency.
- **Podcast**: Hosted by Courtland Allen, it features interviews with successful indie hackers, diving into their strategies and mindsets.
- **Resources and Tools**: Guides, articles, and recommended tools (e.g., no-code platforms like Webflow or Bubble) to help build and scale businesses.
- **Focus on Bootstrapping**: Emphasizes self-funding through personal savings or business revenue, prioritizing profitability over rapid scaling.

## Lobste.rs

**Lobste.rs** is a community-driven, invite-only social news platform focused on technology, programming, and computer science, often described as a more curated alternative to Hacker News.

Its invite-only model and tagging system create a polished, distraction-free experience, though it may feel less accessible than open platforms.[](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20023583)[](https://kevquirk.com/blog/why-lobste-rs-is-better-than-hacker-news)
