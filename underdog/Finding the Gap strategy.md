# 'Finding the Gap' strategy

The 'Finding the Gap' strategy is a method for creating a successful micro-SaaS business by identifying and filling a void left by larger, more established companies.

According to the founder of Youform, Abhishek, the strategy involves these key steps:

* **Step 1: Identify a popular tool.** Find a well-known product and search social media platforms like Twitter and Reddit using keywords such as "[Product] alternative."
* **Step 2: Find pain points or gaps [[03:28](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KaFS4Dxs5k&t=208)].** Look for what users are complaining about with the current products. This could be high pricing or missing features.
* **Step 3: Reach out to users [[03:33](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KaFS4Dxs5k&t=213)].** Contact these users with your solution using a basic landing page that explains how your product addresses their pain points.
* **Step 4: Facilitate migration [[03:45](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KaFS4Dxs5k&t=225)].** Create a tool that allows users to easily migrate their data from the competitor's platform to yours.

This approach is recommended because it allows bootstrapped entrepreneurs to enter a market that is already validated, meaning there's a proven demand for the product, and people are already using it.

## TypeForm

Typeform is a software as a service (SaaS) company that specializes in creating online forms and surveys. It was founded in 2012 by David Okuniev and Robert Mu√±oz and is headquartered in Barcelona, Spain.

What makes Typeform stand out from traditional forms is its conversational and engaging user experience. Instead of displaying all questions on a single page, Typeform presents one question at a time, making the process feel more like a natural conversation. This approach, along with its sleek design and multimedia integration (images, GIFs, videos), is intended to increase user engagement and boost completion rates.

Key features and uses of Typeform include:
* **Intuitive Design:** It offers a user-friendly, no-code platform with customizable templates.
* **Logic Jump:** This feature allows forms to adapt based on user responses, personalizing the experience and ensuring users only see relevant questions.
* **Integrations:** Typeform connects with over 100 other tools, including Google Sheets, Salesforce, HubSpot, and Slack, to automate workflows and streamline data collection.
* **AI Features:** The platform incorporates AI to help users build forms faster, analyze data, and generate follow-up questions.
* **Use Cases:** It is used for various purposes such as lead generation, customer feedback, market research, job applications, quizzes, and event registrations.

Typeform offers a freemium business model with a free plan that has limited responses and features, and paid plans that unlock more advanced functionalities.

## Canny

Canny is a customer feedback management software designed to help product teams collect, analyze, and act on user feedback. It serves as a centralized platform for product managers to gather and prioritize feature requests, plan product roadmaps, and share updates with their users.

### Key Features and Functionality:

* **Feedback Boards:** Canny's core feature is a public or private feedback board where users and internal teams can submit ideas, report bugs, and vote on existing requests. This voting system helps product managers gauge the demand for different features.
* **AI Feedback Management:** Canny uses AI to help with tasks like automatically capturing and deduplicating customer feedback from various sources (like Intercom and Zendesk), and summarizing lengthy comment threads.
* **Roadmapping:** The platform allows teams to create public or private roadmaps that are directly linked to user feedback, ensuring that product decisions are data-driven.
* **Changelogs:** You can publish product updates and release notes to a public changelog, and Canny can automatically notify users who voted on a feature when it is released.
* **User Segmentation:** It allows you to segment users and their feedback by attributes like revenue, company size, or role, which helps in prioritizing requests from high-value customers.

### Who Uses Canny?

Canny is primarily used by B2B software companies, from small startups to large enterprises. The platform's goal is to help businesses become more "customer-driven" by making it easy to close the feedback loop. Notable users mentioned in their case studies include **Ahrefs**, **CircleCI**, and **ClickUp**.

### Pricing Model:

Canny offers a tiered pricing model with a free plan and various paid plans. The pricing is often based on the number of "tracked users," which are external users who have given feedback. While this model can be cost-effective for smaller teams, it can become expensive and unpredictable as a product's user base grows.

## Several alternatives to Typeform and Canny

### Alternatives to Typeform (for online forms and surveys)

* **Yay! Forms:** This is a strong local alternative specifically mentioned as being an alternative to Typeform, with pricing in Brazilian Reais (R$) and customer support in Portuguese. It offers features like AI-powered insights, automatic keyword extraction, and sentiment detection from responses.

* **Google Forms:** While not a Brazilian company, Google Forms is a widely used and completely free alternative. Its simplicity, ease of integration with Google Sheets, and availability in Portuguese make it a very popular choice in Brazil for both personal and professional use.
* **Jotform:** This is a global competitor to Typeform that offers a robust free plan and is available in Portuguese, making it a viable option. It is known for its extensive template library and rich features.

### Alternatives to Canny (for customer feedback and product roadmapping)

Finding a direct Brazilian equivalent to Canny is more challenging, but there are global tools with a presence in Brazil or local companies that offer some of the same functionalities:

* **MindMiners:** This is a Brazilian startup that specializes in market research and offers a platform for creating certified questionnaires. While its focus is broader than just feature feedback, it is a significant local player in the research and insights space.
* **Feedback House:** A Brazilian platform focused on internal team management and feedback. It offers features like 360-degree feedback, performance reviews, and other tools that could be relevant for gathering internal product feedback.
* **Global Alternatives with a Strong Presence:** Many global platforms that compete with Canny, such as **Rapidr** and **Featurebase**, are viable options in Brazil. While they may not have a local office, their services are available globally, and they often offer more affordable pricing compared to Canny. Many of these tools are also designed to be easy to migrate to from Canny.

## Freemium business model

The freemium business model is a pricing strategy where a company offers a basic product or service for free, while charging a "premium" fee for additional features, functionality, or services. The name is a portmanteau of the words "free" and "premium."

The core idea is to attract a large user base with the free offering, then convert a small percentage of those users into paying customers who generate revenue. This model is particularly popular with software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies, mobile apps, and digital platforms where the cost of serving an additional user is low.

### How It Works

The freemium model operates on a few key principles:
* **Low Barrier to Entry:** By offering a free version, companies remove the financial risk for new users, making it easy to sign up and try the product. This helps in achieving rapid user acquisition and brand exposure.
* **Limited vs. Premium:** The free version is intentionally limited in some way. This can be through:
    * **Limited features:** A free video chat app may not include group video calls.
    * **Limited capacity:** A cloud storage service might offer a small amount of free storage (e.g., 2 GB), with an option to pay for more.
    * **Limited usage:** A project management tool might limit the number of projects or users on the free plan.
    * **Advertisements:** A music streaming service might include ads for free users, which are removed for premium subscribers.
* **The Conversion Funnel:** The goal is to demonstrate enough value with the free version to entice users to upgrade to the paid plan. This is often done through in-app prompts, notifications, and by showcasing the benefits of the premium features.

### Advantages and Disadvantages

**Advantages:**
* **Rapid User Acquisition:** The "free" aspect is a powerful marketing tool that can lead to explosive user growth.
* **Lower Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):** Since users can be acquired through word-of-mouth and organic search, companies can save on traditional marketing and sales expenses.
* **User Feedback:** A large base of free users provides a constant stream of feedback for product improvements and market research.

**Disadvantages:**
* **Low Conversion Rates:** A significant challenge is that most free users may never convert to a paid plan. A typical conversion rate is often in the low single-digit percentages.
* **High Operational Costs:** A large user base requires significant investment in infrastructure, servers, and customer support, even if a majority of those users are not generating revenue.
* **Risk of Devaluation:** If the free version is too generous, users may not see a compelling reason to upgrade, which can harm the perception and revenue potential of the premium offering.

### Examples of Companies Using the Freemium Model

* **Spotify:** Offers free, ad-supported music streaming with limited skips, while premium subscribers get an ad-free experience, unlimited skips, and offline listening.
* **Dropbox:** Provides a small amount of free cloud storage and charges for additional space.
* **LinkedIn:** The basic professional networking service is free, but premium subscriptions are available for those who need advanced features for recruiting, sales, or job searching.
* **Trello:** The project management tool offers a free plan with unlimited boards and cards but limits advanced features and integrations to its paid plans.
