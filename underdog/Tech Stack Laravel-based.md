# Tech Stack Laravel-based

Nice one — thanks for sharing this screenshot! Let’s break down this **Laravel-based stack** from the image.

---

### 📦 Stack Breakdown

**Core**

* **Backend**: Laravel (Free) → mature PHP framework, great ecosystem.
* **Hosting**: AWS (\$300) → scalable, reliable infra but not the cheapest.
* **Security/Storage**: Cloudflare (\$200) → covers CDN, DDoS protection, caching.
* **Payments**: Stripe (3% revenue) → industry standard, seamless integration.
* **Fraud Detection**: OpenAI (Free in this context) → seems like they’re using AI models to flag fraud attempts.

**Productivity**

* **Docs**: Slite (\$25) → collaborative docs/wiki.
* **Workspace**: Google Workspace (\$35) → email, drive, docs, meetings.
* **Analytics**: Simple Analytics (\$160) → GDPR-friendly analytics.
* **Feedback**: Canny (\$79) → feature requests + changelogs.
* **Emails**: Mailgun (\$90) → transactional + marketing emails.

### 💰 Monthly Cost

* AWS: \$300
* Cloudflare: \$200
* Slite: \$25
* Workspace: \$35
* Simple Analytics: \$160
* Canny: \$79
* Mailgun: \$90

### ✅ Pros

* **Battle-tested**: Laravel + AWS + Stripe is a very stable setup.
* **Good compliance**: Simple Analytics (privacy-first), Cloudflare (security).
* **Clear separation of concerns**: each tool does its job well.
* **Customer-facing focus**: Feedback (Canny) and Analytics (Simple) help growth.

### ⚠️ Cons

* **Relatively expensive baseline** (\$889/month vs. other stacks you’ve shown at \$85–\$246–\$581–\$112).
* **Laravel**: while solid, has less “modern SaaS momentum” compared to Next.js/NestJS/Node stacks.
* **Vendor lock-in**: AWS pricing + Cloudflare can stack up.
* **Stripe fees**: at scale, 3% eats margin quickly.

---

### 🚦 Verdict

This stack feels like a **post-MVP / early scaling SaaS** setup:

* **Costs are higher**, but you get enterprise-grade infra and compliance-friendly tools.
* More **corporate-friendly** than the AI-assisted lean stacks you shared earlier.
* Great if you’re aiming for **trust, security, and long-term growth** rather than pure MVP agility.
