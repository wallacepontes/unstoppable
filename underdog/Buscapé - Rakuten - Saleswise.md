# Buscapé - Rakuten - Savewise

## Buscapé and Rakuten

Yes, Buscapé and Rakuten both aim to help users save money, but they serve this purpose in different ways due to their distinct platforms and features.

**Buscapé** is primarily a **price comparison platform** focused on helping users in Brazil find the best prices for a wide range of products, especially electronics like smartphones, laptops, and tablets. It aggregates prices from multiple online retailers, allowing users to compare costs, view product specifications, and read reviews to make informed purchasing decisions. Buscapé’s core purpose is to streamline the search for the lowest price across various stores, often providing a free service for users, with revenue generated from retailer advertising.[](https://epigra.com/en/blog/top-price-comparison-websites)

**Rakuten**, on the other hand, is a **cashback and rewards platform** that partners with over 3,500 stores to offer users cashback (typically 2-10%) on purchases made through their platform, alongside coupons and deals. Unlike Buscapé, Rakuten focuses on providing cashback rewards and discounts at checkout rather than directly comparing prices across retailers. It operates globally, with a strong presence in the U.S., and is known for its browser extension that automatically applies cashback and coupons.[](https://www.swiftsalary.com/platform/rakuten-rewards/alternatives/)[](https://michaelryanmoney.com/best-coupon-websites/)

**Key Differences in Purpose**:
- **Focus**: Buscapé emphasizes price comparison to find the cheapest option upfront, while Rakuten focuses on earning cashback and applying coupons for savings after purchase.
- **Market**: Buscapé is tailored to Brazilian consumers and specializes in tech products, whereas Rakuten operates internationally with a broader range of retail categories.
- **Mechanism**: Buscapé shows price differences across retailers; Rakuten incentivizes shopping through its platform with cashback rewards paid quarterly.

**Overlap**: Both platforms aim to save users money by highlighting deals or reducing costs, and they can complement each other. For example, a user could use Buscapé to find the retailer with the lowest price and then access that retailer through Rakuten to earn additional cashback.

In summary, while both Buscapé and Rakuten serve the purpose of helping users save on purchases, Buscapé is more about upfront price comparison, and Rakuten is centered on cashback and coupon rewards.[](https://www.swiftsalary.com/platform/rakuten-rewards/alternatives/)[](https://epigra.com/en/blog/top-price-comparison-websites)[](https://michaelryanmoney.com/best-coupon-websites/)

## Saleswise

Savewise, accessible at getsavewise.com, serves a similar purpose to Buscapé and Rakuten in helping users save money on online purchases, but it operates as a **shopping rewards optimizer** with a unique approach focused on maximizing cashback, airline miles, and credit card points. Like Buscapé, it compares offers across multiple platforms, and like Rakuten, it emphasizes cashback and rewards, but it combines these features with additional tools for stacking rewards and automating savings.

**Purpose of Savewise**:
Savewise is designed to help users maximize returns on online shopping by comparing cashback, points, and miles offers across over 20 shopping portals (e.g., Rakuten, Capital One Shopping) and integrating card-linked offers from providers like Amex and Chase. Its goal is to streamline the process of finding the best deals and stacking rewards to ensure users earn the most from every purchase, covering over 12,000 online stores.[](https://eliteai.tools/tool/savewise)

**Key Features**:
- **Offer Comparison**: Instantly compares cashback, points, and miles across multiple shopping portals to identify the most lucrative option for a specific store.[](https://eliteai.tools/tool/savewise)
- **Reward Stacking**: Allows users to combine shopping portal rewards with credit card offers (e.g., Amex or Chase) for maximum savings.[](https://eliteai.tools/tool/savewise)
- **Auto-Activation**: Automatically activates Amex and Chase card offers with one click, without storing sensitive banking information.[](https://upgradedpoints.com/news/savewise-online-shopping-tool/)[](https://eliteai.tools/tool/savewise)
- **Browser Extension**: A Chrome, Firefox, or Safari extension displays real-time offers while browsing retailer websites, similar to Rakuten’s extension.[](https://upgradedpoints.com/news/savewise-online-shopping-tool/)[](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/savewise/id6740288292?mt=12)
- **Offer History & Trends**: Provides charts to track historical offer data, helping users decide the best time to buy.[](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/savewise/id6740288292?mt=12)

- **Subscription Manager and Price Drop Alerts**: Tracks subscriptions and notifies users of price increases or sales on wish-listed items.[](https://betalist.com/startups/savewise)

**Comparison to Buscapé and Rakuten**:
- **Similarities**: Like Buscapé, Savewise compares offers across multiple platforms to find the best deal, though it focuses on rewards (cashback, points, miles) rather than just upfront prices. Like Rakuten, it emphasizes cashback and rewards but extends this by integrating credit card offers and covering more portals.
- **Differences**: Savewise is not a shopping portal itself (unlike Rakuten) but an aggregator, similar to CashbackMonitor, with added features like auto-activation of card offers and detailed trend analysis. Unlike Buscapé’s focus on price comparison for Brazilian consumers, Savewise has a global reach and emphasizes reward optimization across a broader range of categories.[](https://upgradedpoints.com/news/savewise-online-shopping-tool/)[](https://eliteai.tools/tool/savewise)
- **Unique Advantage**: Savewise’s ability to stack portal rewards with card-linked offers and auto-activate them sets it apart, offering a more integrated approach than either Buscapé or Rakuten. Its browser extension and historical data also provide a more proactive and data-driven shopping experience.[](https://eliteai.tools/tool/savewise)[](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/savewise/id6740288292?mt=12)

**Tiers**:
- **Basic (Free)**: Access to most features, including offer comparison and manual card offer syncing.
- **Pro (Monthly, $5/month or $59/year; Lifetime, $119)**: Adds longer offer history, auto-syncing, custom point valuations, and alerts. Discounts are available (e.g., 20% off with code FREQUENTMILER).[](https://frequentmiler.com/savewise/)

In summary, Savewise aligns with the purpose of finding offers and discounts like Buscapé and Rakuten but stands out by combining price comparison, cashback optimization, and credit card offer stacking in one platform, with tools like auto-activation and trend analysis to maximize savings. It’s particularly useful for users who want to streamline and enhance their rewards-earning strategy across multiple portals and cards.[](https://eliteai.tools/tool/savewise)
