# Building on platforms 

In the video about the business model of Data Fetcher, a tool built on top of Airtable, the founder Andy discusses the pros and cons of building on a growing platform [[02:18](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvtsM8Nk72c&t=138)]. He also provides a six-step framework for finding business ideas on such platforms.

The **business model** relies on leveraging an existing, growing platform's user base and marketplace for distribution. The advantages are a steady stream of qualified leads and credibility from platform approval. This is considered an "indie hacker sweet spot" because the opportunity is significant but not large enough to attract extensive venture capital-backed competition.

The primary disadvantage, or **platform risk**, is the possibility that the platform will build a native feature that makes your tool obsolete.

### **Six-Step Framework for Finding Business Ideas**

1.  **Find the platform:** Identify growing platforms using tools like "Exploding Topics."[ET](https://explodingtopics.com/)
2.  **Find a pain point:** Look for problems discussed in the platform's forums, on Reddit, or on Twitter.
3.  **Borrow a proven pattern:** Adapt a successful add-on from a more established platform (e.g., Google Sheets) to the new platform.
4.  **Check for integration capabilities:** Ensure the platform has a public API or a marketplace SDK that allows you to build a solution.
5.  **Do the napkin math:** Estimate the opportunity size based on the platform's user base, the problem's prevalence, and what users would pay.
6.  **Assess platform risk:** Research the platform's roadmap and forums to see if they might build a similar feature natively.

## Airtable

Airtable is a cloud-based collaboration service that is a hybrid of a spreadsheet and a relational database. It was founded in 2012 and is headquartered in San Francisco.

### Key Features and Use Cases
* **Database-like functionality:** Unlike traditional spreadsheets like Excel or Google Sheets, Airtable is built on a relational database structure. This allows users to link records between different tables, creating more complex and interconnected data models.
* **Versatile data types:** It supports a wide variety of data types in its fields (columns), including text, numbers, dates, checkboxes, attachments, and more.
* **Customizable views:** Airtable allows users to visualize their data in multiple ways, such as a traditional grid (spreadsheet-like), calendar, Kanban board, or gallery view. This flexibility is particularly useful for different workflows.
* **No-code/low-code platform:** It is a powerful no-code tool that enables users to create custom applications and automate workflows without writing a single line of code. It also has an API and extensions for more technical users to build custom scripts and integrations.
* **Collaboration:** It is designed for multi-user collaboration, allowing teams to work together in real-time with features like comments, record-level access control, and revision history.

### Airtable vs. Spreadsheets
The main difference is that Airtable is a database at its core, while Excel and Google Sheets are primarily spreadsheets. This means Airtable is better suited for managing complex data relationships and workflows, while spreadsheets are better for tasks like data analysis, visualization of numerical data, and simple calculations. While spreadsheets are often free, Airtable has a free plan with limitations and charges for additional users and features.
