# 5 steps marketing playbook

Based on the video from Save Wise, here are the five steps of the marketing playbook outlined by its founder, Ovnish:

1.  **Brainstorm Keywords and Interests**: Identify 5-15 keywords, interests, and demographics that describe your ideal customers. Use these to find relevant communities on platforms like Reddit and Facebook [[04:26](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X4VneEHvig&t=266)].
2.  **Observe and Understand the Community**: Before posting, spend time observing the community to understand what people are talking about and how they communicate [[05:22](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X4VneEHvig&t=322)].
3.  **Define Your Goal and Start in the Comments**: Determine a specific goal for each community and begin by commenting on existing posts to see if your contributions resonate [[06:23](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X4VneEHvig&t=383)].
4.  **Set Up Keyword Alerts**: Use a tool like F5bot to set up real-time keyword alerts for your product or topic area, allowing you to monitor conversations and identify opportunities [[06:46](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X4VneEHvig&t=406)].
5.  **Be Helpful**: Consistently provide helpful advice and tips to build credibility and earn the right to organically mention your product [[07:20](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X4VneEHvig&t=440)].
