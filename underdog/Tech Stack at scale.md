# Tech Scale at Scale

Perfect — now we’re talking at **scale**. You’ve shared a spend breakdown for **24 products, 100k+ B2B users, and 10M+ B2B2C users**, with **\$76,082.42 spent in August**.

I’ll categorize the stack **just like before** (infra, DB, support, etc.) so you can see what’s driving cost at scale:

---

## 🏗️ Infrastructure & Hosting

* **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** – \$4,480.12
* **Google Cloud** – \$2,134.74
* **Hetzner** – \$864.71
* **DigitalOcean** – \$148.26
* **Cloudflare (CDN, security, DNS)** – \$350.20
* **BunnyCDN** – \$170.00

👉 **Infra subtotal: \$8,147.99 (\~11%)**
Mix of cloud providers. Likely using AWS/GCP for core workloads, Hetzner for cost-efficient compute, Cloudflare/Bunny for delivery.

---

## 🗄️ Databases & Storage

* **MongoDB Atlas** – \$4,251.50
* **Supabase (Postgres + Auth)** – \$75.00
* **Pinecone (vector DB)** – \$61.47

## Lean this stack down

Yes — I can help you **lean this stack down** while keeping it ready for **24 products, 100k+ B2B and 10M+ B2B2C users**.

Right now, you’re spending **\$76k/month**, with **42% on AI**, \~13% on contractors, and the rest spread across infra, DB, and SaaS tools.

Here’s a **lean strategy by category**:

---

## 🧠 AI & Machine Learning (42% → reduce to 15–20%)

**Now:** OpenAI \$15.4k, Anthropic \$16k, Perplexity \$204, ElevenLabs \$22, Replicate \$3.5
**Plan:**

* Consolidate **LLM vendors**: pick **one foundation model provider** (either OpenAI or Anthropic) and negotiate **volume discounts / enterprise credits**. At \$30k/month usage, you should get **30–50% off**.
* Use **open-source models** (LLaMA 3.1, Mistral) for non-critical workloads (summaries, embeddings) hosted on your own infra (Hetzner/GCP GPUs).
* Cache & re-use responses (vector DB + dedupe requests) → reduces API calls 20–30%.

👉 **Savings:** \$10k–15k/month.

---

## 👷 Contractors (13% → reduce to 8%)

**Now:** \$10,137.78
**Plan:**

* Shift routine devops/QA tasks to automation (CI/CD pipelines, GhostInspector replaced with Playwright).
* Retain only **specialized contractors** (AI, security, growth).
* Hire 1–2 full-time engineers instead of 5–6 scattered freelancers.

👉 **Savings:** \$3k–4k/month.

---

## 🏗️ Infra & Hosting (11% → reduce to 8%)

**Now:** AWS \$4.5k, GCP \$2.1k, Hetzner \$865, DO \$148, Cloudflare \$350, BunnyCDN \$170
**Plan:**

* Consolidate workloads → move most compute/storage to **Hetzner** (much cheaper than AWS/GCP).
* Keep AWS/GCP only for ML training / managed services you can’t migrate.
* Replace **BunnyCDN + Cloudflare mix** with just Cloudflare (includes CDN + security).

👉 **Savings:** \$2k–3k/month.

---

## 🗄️ Databases & Storage (7% → reduce to 5%)

**Now:** MongoDB \$4.2k, Supabase \$75, Pinecone \$61, Imgix \$808
**Plan:**

* Consolidate into **Postgres + Supabase** for core DBs.
* Use **pgvector** instead of Pinecone for embeddings (cut Pinecone cost).
* Replace Imgix with **Cloudflare Images** or Supabase Storage.

👉 **Savings:** \$2k/month.

---

## ✉️ Communication & Payments (8% → reduce to 6%)

**Now:** PayPal \$4.6k fees, Twilio \$315, Mailgun \$96, Mailjet \$17, Intercom \$248, Crisp \$540, Hushed \$5
**Plan:**

* **Replace PayPal** with Stripe (lower fees at scale, \~2.9% → 2.2% with volume).
* Consolidate messaging (Intercom + Crisp → just one).
* Replace Mailgun/Mailjet with **Bento** (cheaper automation).

👉 **Savings:** \$1k–2k/month + lower transaction fees.

---

## 👩‍💻 Developer Tools (10% → reduce to 6%)

**Now:** Atlassian \$690, Notion \$338, Figma \$420, Zoho \$374, Sentry \$847, scraping APIs \~\$2.4k, Exa \$1.5k, etc.
**Plan:**

* Consolidate: Pick **one PM tool** (Atlassian OR Notion, not both).
* Reduce scraping tools: consolidate DataforSEO, Serper, Scrapingbee, Apify, Firecrawl into **one robust pipeline**.
* Replace Exa with open-source vector search / ElasticSearch.
* Negotiate Sentry enterprise pricing (or move to open-source alternative like OpenTelemetry + Grafana).

👉 **Savings:** \$2k–3k/month.

---

## 📈 Business Tools (9% → reduce to 5%)

**Now:** Google Workspace \$1.9k, Microsoft \$2.3k, Zoom \$2.4k, Slack \$137, StreamYard \$107, Webflow \$24, Loom \$15
**Plan:**

* **Cut overlap:** if using Google Workspace, drop Microsoft licenses except where strictly needed.
* Replace Zoom with **Google Meet** (included in Workspace).
* Replace StreamYard with OBS or Riverside (cheaper).
* Consolidate into Slack + Workspace only.

👉 **Savings:** \$3k–4k/month.

---

## 🎨 Marketing (0.6%)

Already lean, not a major target.
