# Obviously Awesome

The core idea behind **April Dunford’s book *Obviously Awesome*** is that **great products don’t sell themselves**—they need to be positioned in a way that customers can quickly understand their value, relevance, and uniqueness.

Dunford argues that many good products fail not because they lack features or quality, but because they’re framed in a way that makes them confusing, hard to categorize, or irrelevant in the customer’s mind.

Here are the key points of the book’s idea:

1. **Positioning is about context.**
   A product’s value is only clear when customers understand it relative to alternatives and within the right frame of reference (e.g., is Slack a chat tool, an email replacement, or a productivity platform?).

2. **Customers need to “get it” fast.**
   People make snap judgments—if they don’t immediately understand what your product is and why it matters, they move on.

3. **Positioning = perception shaping.**
   Positioning defines:

   * Who your **target customers** are
   * What **category** you’re in (frame of reference)
   * What makes you **different/better** from alternatives
   * The **value** you deliver
   * The **proof** that backs it up

4. **Positioning should be deliberate.**
   Many companies “default” into a position based on how they started or what their first customers thought, but deliberate positioning can unlock growth and new markets.

5. **There’s a practical process.**
   Dunford lays out a 10-step process to nail positioning, including identifying true competitive alternatives, teasing out unique strengths, finding your best-fit customers, and choosing a market frame that highlights your product’s strengths.

👉 **In short:** The idea is that *positioning is the secret weapon for growth*. If you nail it, customers instantly see why your product is valuable, buy it, and love it.

Do you want me to also break down the **10-step positioning process** she proposes in the book?

## Deliberate Positioning 
Deliberate positioning is the intentional act of establishing a specific identity, reputation, or relationship with others, rather than letting it happen by chance. In marketing, it involves creating a distinct place in a customer's mind, while in social contexts, it refers to a strategic way of presenting oneself or others through conversation and actions to achieve a goal. The key is conscious intent and careful planning to control how one is perceived. 

### Key Aspects of Deliberate Positioning
- Intentionality: It is a planned action, not a spontaneous or accidental one. 
- Strategic: It serves a specific purpose or outcome. 
- Mindspace Occupation: In business, it's about claiming a valuable, unique spot in the customer's mind. 
- Discursive Process: In conversations, it involves how individuals are situated within a storyline, influencing how others perceive them. 
- Controlled Perception: It's a way to shape how others see you, your ideas, or your offers, rather than relying on them to connect the dots on their own. 
### Examples of Deliberate Positioning
1. Brand Positioning:
A brand like Dove deliberately positions itself to celebrate real beauty, creating an emotional connection with consumers and differentiating itself from competitors. 
2. Self-Positioning:
An individual might position themselves in a job interview to portray a specific image to the hiring manager, which is more than just a factual account of their experience. 
3. Social Positioning:
In a conversation, someone might use specific language or refer to particular experiences to position themselves as an expert in a field. 
4. Marketing Strategy:
A company might strategically position its product or service to a specific, targeted audience with tailored messaging. 

### Why it Matters
1. Differentiation:
Helps a brand or individual stand out in a crowded and competitive landscape. 
2. Building Trust and Loyalty:
Effective positioning fosters familiarity and trust with the target audience. 
3. Competitive Advantage:
Clear positioning can lead to higher profit margins and market power. 
4. Achieving Goals:
Whether in business or social interactions, deliberate positioning helps achieve desired outcomes by controlling perception. 


## Gap between the founder’s/owner’s idea of the product and the customer’s idea of the product.

In *Obviously Awesome*, April Dunford explains that this gap is where most **positioning problems** live. Here’s how it typically plays out:

---

### 1. **Owner’s (Founder’s) Idea**

* Founders usually see the product as **a solution to a problem they personally understand deeply**.
* They’re close to the technology, the features, and the origin story (“We built this to solve *X* in a new way”).
* The positioning often reflects their internal perspective — *what it does* and *how it’s built*.

Example:
“We built a real-time messaging system with integrations to everything in your workflow.”

---

### 2. **Customer’s Idea**

* Customers don’t care about the origin story or tech stack.
* They need to know: **“What is this? Is it for me? Why is it better than what I’m already using?”**
* Customers often put the product into a mental “box” (category) that may not match the founder’s intention.

Example:
Customer hears the above and thinks:
“Oh, so it’s like MSN Messenger for work?”
(Which misses the *true value* of Slack: an email replacement + team productivity platform).

---

### 3. **The Positioning Problem**

The problem arises when:

* The **owner positions the product around features** (their perspective), but…
* The **customer interprets it differently**, often comparing it to the wrong alternatives.

This misalignment creates confusion:

* Customers don’t “get it.”
* Sales cycles drag on.
* Marketing attracts the wrong buyers.
* Growth stalls, even though the product might be great.

---

### 4. **Positioning Bridges the Gap**

Good positioning takes the **owner’s deep knowledge** of what makes the product unique and reframes it in **language and context customers already understand**.

It shifts the conversation from:

* *“Here’s what we built and why it’s cool”* → Owner’s idea
  to
* *“Here’s how this helps you, compared to what you already know/use”* → Customer’s idea

---

✅ **So the positioning problem = translation problem.**
If you don’t deliberately shape how your product is perceived, customers will position it for you — and usually in the wrong category.

## **re-positioning**, which is really at the heart of April Dunford’s book.

Her framework is designed to help you *deliberately reset* how your product is perceived when the current positioning isn’t working (or when your market has shifted).

Here’s a breakdown of the **re-positioning framework** from *Obviously Awesome*:

---

## 🔑 The 10-Step Positioning Process

### 1. **Understand Competitive Alternatives**

* Ask: *“What would customers do if our product didn’t exist?”*
* This shows the **true competition** (sometimes not even another product — it might be Excel, email, or manual work).

---

### 2. **Identify Your Unique Features**

* What capabilities do you have that alternatives lack?
* Make a list, even if they seem small or technical.

---

### 3. **Translate Features into Value**

* For each unique feature, ask: *“So what?”* until you reach the **meaningful benefit for the customer**.
* Example: *“Our system is real-time” → so what? → “Teams collaborate instantly” → so what? → “They move projects faster.”*

---

### 4. **Find Who Cares the Most (Best-fit Customers)**

* Not all customers value your strengths equally.
* Identify the **customer segments** that care the most about the value you deliver.

---

### 5. **Define Your True Market Category (Frame of Reference)**

* Choose the **context** that makes your strengths obvious.
* Example: Slack wasn’t positioned as “chat,” but as an “email replacement.”
* The right category highlights your value; the wrong one hides it.

---

### 6. **Map the Real Competitive Landscape**

* Once you pick a category, you must understand how customers will compare you within it.
* What do buyers expect in this category?

---

### 7. **Articulate Your Differentiators**

* Clearly explain: *“Compared to alternatives in this category, we are uniquely better because…”*

---

### 8. **Create a Market Narrative (The Story)**

* Tie everything into a story customers can follow:

  * Problem → Current alternatives → Why they fail → Your product → Why you’re the obvious best choice.

---

### 9. **Test Your Positioning**

* Run it by customers, prospects, and sales teams.
* See if it makes people say *“Oh, I get it now!”*

---

### 10. **Roll It Out Across Teams**

* Positioning isn’t just marketing copy.
* It should influence **sales pitches, product roadmap, marketing campaigns, pricing, and partnerships**.

---

## 🚀 The Re-positioning Mindset

* **It’s not permanent.** Positioning evolves as markets, competitors, and customers change.
* **It’s not just slogans.** Positioning is the *foundation* for all messaging and strategy.
* **It’s not about you.** It’s about helping customers quickly grasp why your product matters *to them*.

---

👉 In short:
Re-positioning = taking what you already know about your product’s unique strengths and reframing it in a **market context where those strengths really shine**.

---

## 5-step positioning framework

This is essentially April Dunford’s **simplified method** to actually *implement* re-positioning. Let’s break down how you can **apply each step in practice**:

---

## 🔧 How to Implement the Strategies

### 1. **Competitive Alternatives**

👉 *If you didn’t exist, what would customers use?*

* Don’t just think of direct competitors — think of *real choices customers make*.
* Ex: For a new project management tool, alternatives might be **Excel, email, Trello, or “do nothing.”**

✅ Action: Interview customers and prospects. Ask: *“What would you use if you couldn’t use us?”*

---

### 2. **Key Unique Attributes**

👉 *What features/capabilities do you have that alternatives do not?*

* Make a **feature inventory**. Highlight what’s **truly different**.
* Be honest: a feature is “unique” only if customers notice and competitors don’t offer it.

✅ Action: Run a “feature gap” analysis against alternatives.

---

### 3. **Value**

👉 *What value do those attributes enable for customers?*

* Translate features → benefits → customer outcomes.
* Example: *“AI-driven analytics” → faster insights → better decisions → cost savings.*

✅ Action: Use the **“so what?” test** on every feature until you reach a business outcome.

---

### 4. **Customers that Care**

👉 *Who cares a lot about that value?*

* Not every segment values your differentiators.
* Example: Your “compliance automation” matters most to **finance & healthcare companies**, less to startups.

✅ Action: Segment your market. Find the customers who **urgently feel the pain your product solves best**.

---

### 5. **Market You Win**

👉 *What context makes the value obvious to your target segments?*

* Choose a **market category / frame of reference** where your strengths shine.
* Example: Slack succeeded by positioning as an **“email replacement”**, not as “chat.”

✅ Action: Test different frames. Pitch your product as X, Y, Z and see which makes customers “get it” fastest.

---

## 🏆 Example: Imagine a Startup Offering AI-Powered Meeting Notes

1. **Competitive Alternatives** → People use **manual note-taking, Otter.ai, or Zoom transcripts**.
2. **Key Unique Attributes** → Real-time action item extraction + integrations with Jira/Asana.
3. **Value** → No tasks are lost, teams move projects faster, better accountability.
4. **Customers that Care** → Project managers and agile teams (not just general users).
5. **Market You Win** → Position as a **“Project Execution Accelerator”**, not just “transcription.”

---

👉 By running through these steps, you deliberately **re-position** from “just another AI note-taker” → to “a productivity tool that ensures projects never lose momentum.”
