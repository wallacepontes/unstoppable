# Tech Stack 

This third stack feels like a **balanced “startup-friendly” setup** — lower cost than the second one, more structured than your first lean stack. Let’s analyze it:

---

### 📦 Stack Breakdown

**Extensions / Productivity**

* TypeScript (Free), React (Free), Node.js (Free), PostgreSQL (Free), shadcn/ui (Free)
* Airtable (\$45) → used here both as extension + operations (task/CRM-ish).

**Core Tech**

* Backend: Node.js + PostgreSQL (Free) → standard, solid.
* Frontend: Next.js + shadcn/ui (Free) → modern, developer-friendly.
* Hosting: Heroku (\$25) → easy deploys, but more expensive than Hetzner/Coolify for scaling.

**Business Layer**

* Scheduling: Hetzner (\$38) → maybe for cron/background jobs.
* Support: HelpScout (\$25) → lightweight customer support desk.
* Email: Fastmail (\$5) → cheap transactional emails.
* Newsletter: MailerLite (\$9) → affordable email marketing.
* Analytics:

  * Plausible (pay as you go) → website analytics.
  * ChartMogul (\$99) → revenue/subscription analytics.
* Operations: Airtable (\$45) → used as CRM/project management.

---

### 💰 Estimated Monthly Cost

* Heroku: \$25
* Hetzner: \$38
* HelpScout: \$25
* Fastmail: \$5
* MailerLite: \$9
* Airtable: \$45
* ChartMogul: \$99
* (Extensions + core stack: free)

👉 **Total fixed cost \~ \$246/month + Plausible usage**

---

### ✅ Pros

* **Cheap for the features**: You get hosting, support, analytics, newsletter, CRM-like ops for <\$250/month.
* **Well-balanced**: Not overkill like the \$581/month stack, but more structured than your \$85 stack.
* **Established tools**: Heroku, HelpScout, Airtable, ChartMogul are all trusted SaaS standards.

### ⚠️ Cons

* **Scalability risk**: Heroku gets pricey quickly if you grow.
* **Fragmented stack**: Multiple SaaS vendors to manage (emails on Fastmail, newsletters on MailerLite, analytics split between Plausible & ChartMogul).
* **Operations overlap**: Using Airtable for both “extension” and “operations” — could be replaced by Notion or an internal dashboard.

---

### 🚦 Verdict

* This stack is a **good middle ground**: more business-oriented than your lean \$85 stack, but not as costly as the \$581 enterprise one.
* Great if you’re ready to **track revenue, support, and newsletters seriously** but still want to stay under \$300/month.

Got it 👍 let’s run the numbers for your **\$23k/month micro-SaaS** with those costs and 85% margins.

---

### 📊 Monthly Breakdown

**Revenue**: \$23,000

**Costs**:

* Hosting: \$2,500
* SaaS tools: \$1,000
* Coworking: \$150
  **Total costs = \$3,650**

---

### 💰 Profit

* Gross Profit = \$23,000 − \$3,650 = **\$19,350**
* Profit Margin = \$19,350 ÷ \$23,000 ≈ **84.1%** → aligns with your stated 85%.

---

### 📈 Annual Projection

* Revenue: \$276,000/year
* Costs: \$43,800/year
* Profit: \$232,200/year

---

👉 This is **very healthy** for a micro-SaaS. Typical SaaS margins (after infra + tools) range between **70–90%**, so you’re operating at the high end.
