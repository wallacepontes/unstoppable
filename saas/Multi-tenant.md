## Multi-tenant

Multi-tenancy refers to a software architecture in which a single instance of a software application serves multiple customers or "tenants." Each tenant typically operates in isolation from others, with their data, configurations, and usage separated and secured from other tenants. 

In a multi-tenant system:

1. **Shared Resources**: Resources such as computing power, storage, and database infrastructure are shared among multiple tenants, optimizing resource utilization.

2. **Isolation**: Tenants are logically isolated from each other, meaning that one tenant's data and operations are not accessible or visible to another tenant.

3. **Customization**: Despite sharing the same underlying software instance, tenants can often customize their user experience, configurations, and workflows according to their needs.

4. **Efficiency and Cost-Effectiveness**: Multi-tenancy can be more cost-effective for both the provider and the tenants since resources are shared and managed centrally.

5. **Scalability**: The architecture should be designed to scale efficiently as the number of tenants grows, ensuring performance and reliability for all users.

Multi-tenancy is commonly found in cloud-based software applications, including Software as a Service (SaaS) offerings, where a single application instance serves multiple customers over the internet. It allows SaaS providers to deliver cost-effective solutions while maintaining scalability, security, and customization options for their customers.

## Dedicated Instances with Follower (Database)

"Dedicated Instances with Follower" is a concept in the context of distributed systems and databases, particularly associated with database replication and high availability architectures. 

In a traditional database setup, you might have a single database instance handling all read and write operations. However, as the workload grows, this setup might become a bottleneck in terms of performance and availability. To address this, databases often implement replication, where changes made to a primary (master) database instance are asynchronously or synchronously copied to one or more secondary (replica) instances.

In a setup with "Dedicated Instances with Follower", each replica instance is dedicated to serving read requests, while the primary instance handles write requests. This setup improves the overall performance of the system by distributing the read workload across multiple instances, thus reducing the load on the primary instance.

Additionally, the "Follower" in this setup refers to a specific type of replica instance that is configured to closely follow the primary instance, ensuring that it stays up-to-date with the latest changes. This typically involves synchronous replication, where the primary instance waits for confirmation from the follower instance that changes have been successfully applied before acknowledging a write operation as committed.

Overall, "Dedicated Instances with Follower" is a strategy for improving the scalability and availability of database systems by separating read and write workloads and ensuring that replica instances closely follow the primary instance to provide up-to-date data for read operations.
