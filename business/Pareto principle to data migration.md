# Pareto principle to data migration

The Pareto principle states that roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes for many outcomes. When you have too much you can or should do, think twice about what you must do. Always focus on the impact, not activities. 

In applying the Pareto principle to your data migration project, you can prioritize activities that have the most substantial impact on the success of the migration while reducing effort on less impactful tasks. Here’s a strategy:

1. **Identify Key Objectives and Constraints**  
   Focus on aspects critical to project success, such as ensuring data integrity, managing correlation IDs across systems, and establishing a smooth transformation process. Given that this is an Oracle-centric project with intermediate PostgreSQL storage, prioritize processes that safeguard data consistency and quality between the two databases.

2. **Segment and Prioritize Data**  
   Not all data may be equally critical to migrate first. Consider segmenting customers or data entities by their impact on operations. Migrate high-priority data entities (e.g., customers with active transactions or recent POs) first, ensuring any hiccups are minimized before tackling less critical data.

3. **Automate Where Possible**  
   Use Spring Batch’s automation capabilities for repeatable tasks. This can reduce manual effort for tasks like recreating sanity tables, running scheduled migrations, and performing validations, allowing you to focus on resolving issues rather than routine processes.

4. **Focus on Key Metrics for Validation**  
   Rather than validating every detail at every step, focus on KPIs that provide a high-level view of success, such as the number of customers migrated without errors, correlation ID accuracy, and sanity process success rates. By streamlining these checkpoints, you get fast feedback on critical issues.

5. **Leverage Parallel Processing**  
   Prioritize high-impact migration windows, and use parallel processing to handle large volumes of critical data. This can help manage the load more efficiently, especially as you have access to the five Cassandra pods and can distribute workloads effectively.

6. **Monitor and Optimize Post-Migration**  
   Plan a brief post-migration validation that concentrates on operational stability. Focus on checking KPIs in the target environment and ensure atomic transactions are functioning as intended for the migrated customers. This allows for quick adjustments and continued improvements for subsequent migration waves.

By zeroing in on these high-impact areas, you can significantly enhance the project’s efficiency and reduce unnecessary complexity in execution.
