# Assess Context, Choose Method

It's evident from your analysis that a one-size-fits-all approach to project delivery methods rarely works effectively. Context matters significantly, and selecting the appropriate delivery method can make a substantial difference in the success of a project. Your breakdown of the different environments (Simple, Complicated, Complex, and Chaotic) and their corresponding recommended approaches provides a clear guideline for project teams to assess their situation and make informed decisions.

By considering factors such as the level of problem definition and the clarity of the solution, teams can align their delivery method with the specific needs of their project. This not only enhances efficiency but also increases the likelihood of achieving the desired outcomes.

Your emphasis on the importance of taking a moment to assess the contextual environment before diving into a project is crucial. Rushing into a default delivery method without considering whether it's the best fit for the situation can lead to wasted time, resources, and ultimately, project failure.

By promoting a more thoughtful and tailored approach to project delivery, you're advocating for a mindset shift that prioritizes effectiveness over familiarity or convenience. This can ultimately lead to better outcomes and more successful project implementations.

## if all you have is a hammer, everythinh looks like a nail! It s undoubtedly a mindset shift that prioritizes effectiveness over the convenience of a hammer.

Absolutely, the "hammer and nail" analogy perfectly captures the essence of the problem. When teams are limited to using only one method or approach, they may try to force-fit it into every situation, regardless of whether it's the most appropriate tool for the job. This can lead to suboptimal results and missed opportunities for innovation and problem-solving.

Encouraging a mindset shift towards prioritizing effectiveness means recognizing that there are multiple tools available, and the key is to select the right one for each unique situation. This requires flexibility, adaptability, and a willingness to step back and assess the context before jumping into action.

By embracing this mindset, teams can avoid the pitfalls of relying too heavily on familiar methods and instead focus on finding the best solutions for the challenges they face. This can lead to more creative problem-solving, better outcomes, and ultimately, greater success in achieving project goals.

## Context below

I see the same mistake happen time and time again.

A project team is mobilised to deliver a technology-enabled business improvement. However, instead of assessing the contextual environment and choosing an approach and delivery method that is appropriate for their situation, they adopt their default go-to method and crack on without further thought.

To explain what I mean by 'delivery method', I've listed out some examples of Waterfall and Agile methods...

WATERFALL:
- PRINCE2
- V-Model
- SSADM - Traditional Waterfall

AGILE:
- SCRUM
- Kanban
- XP
- DSDM

The 'default go-to methods' employed by teams are often hybrid combinations, rather than pure textbook implementations, that come about for a variety of reasons. Some common ones I've witnessed include:
- Standard approach dictated and/or tracked by the Programme Management Office
- Project members attended a recent training course
- Project Manager uses the method he/she is most familiar with
- Influential project member evangelises a method based on book/blog/etc they read recently

I'm sure there are many other reasons too!

Here's the thing! There are no inherently bad methods. Each has its place. When applied in the right context, the right method enables efficient and effective delivery within that context.

The trouble occurs when the delivery method isn't a good fit for the given situation.

Here's a super-quick Context Assessment Guide (inspired by the Cynefin Framework) that helps to select an appropriate delivery approach...

A. Simple/Clear Environment: Well-Understood Problem -> Obvious Solution
** Minimise Project Management overhead, implement 'Best Practice' as a BAU activity (if possible)

B. Complicated Environment: Well-Defined Problem -> Expert-Designed Solution
** Utilise a Waterfall Project Delivery Method to implement a 'Good Practice' solution

C. Complex Environment: Problem Defined (possibly not fully understood) -> Solution Not Well-Defined
** Utilise an iterative Agile Delivery Method to experiment (test hypotheses) to implement 'Emergent Practices'

D. Chaotic Environment: Problem Not Defined -> Solution Not Defined
** Not appropriate for Project delivery, hand back to Senior Management to handle

So next time you are involved with mobilising a tech project, or if you are currently in the trenches delivering technology-enabled change, stop for a second to consider your contextual environment and the best-fit deliver approach.... it might help to get where you are heading more EFFICIENTLY and more EFFECTIVELY.
