## Different roles contribute

In a data migration project, different roles contribute in unique ways depending on the complexity and scope of the migration. Here's a breakdown of the most suitable roles:

### 1. **Data Architect**:
   - **Role**: The Data Architect is responsible for the overall design and architecture of the data flow from the legacy systems to the target systems. They ensure that the structure, relationships, and formats of the data are properly mapped and defined.
   - **Key Responsibilities**:
     - Defining the data migration strategy.
     - Designing data models for both source and target systems.
     - Ensuring data quality, consistency, and governance.
     - Setting up processes for transformation rules and compliance.
   - **Ideal when**: You need a top-level architect who can design the entire framework and solve complex data structure challenges.

### 2. **Data Engineer**:
   - **Role**: The Data Engineer handles the practical implementation of the migration, including data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes. They often use specific tools and programming to move the data between environments.
   - **Key Responsibilities**:
     - Developing ETL scripts or using migration tools.
     - Optimizing data pipelines for efficiency and performance.
     - Ensuring that the data is correctly transformed during the migration.
     - Troubleshooting issues that arise during the migration process.
   - **Ideal when**: The technical implementation and optimization of the migration process is the primary concern.

### 3. **Data Migration Specialist**:
   - **Role**: This is often a hybrid role that can vary but typically focuses on planning, managing, and executing the migration itself. It may involve elements of both architecture and engineering but with a specific focus on migration execution.
   - **Key Responsibilities**:
     - Coordinating the entire data migration process.
     - Working closely with both Data Architects and Engineers to ensure smooth data flow.
     - Testing data after migration for accuracy and consistency.
     - Handling data cleansing and validation tasks.
   - **Ideal when**: The primary focus is on overseeing and managing the migration execution, with some hands-on work in the migration process.

### Conclusion:
For a **large and complex migration** project, you'll need a **Data Architect** to define the structure and strategy, a **Data Engineer** to implement the migration scripts and tools, and a **Data Migration Specialist** to manage and execute the overall process. 

If the migration is more straightforward, you could lean more on a Data Engineer with some architecture knowledge or a Data Migration Specialist who can coordinate everything effectively.

## what are the key subsets for this work?

In a data migration project, the work is divided into several key subsets that ensure a structured and efficient migration process. Here are the main subsets for such a project:

### 1. **Discovery and Planning**
   - **Objective**: Understand the scope, data sources, and requirements for the migration.
   - **Key Activities**:
     - Assessing the legacy systems (source databases or platforms).
     - Defining business requirements and goals for the target system.
     - Identifying data sources, types, volumes, and relationships.
     - Mapping out the migration strategy (e.g., incremental, big bang, or phased).
     - Setting timelines, identifying key stakeholders, and allocating resources.
   - **Roles Involved**: Data Architect, Project Manager, Business Analyst.

### 2. **Data Assessment and Profiling**
   - **Objective**: Analyze the quality, completeness, and consistency of the data to be migrated.
   - **Key Activities**:
     - Profiling the data to identify anomalies, missing values, or inconsistencies.
     - Assessing data dependencies and relationships across systems.
     - Classifying data into categories such as critical, non-critical, and obsolete.
     - Identifying any data cleansing or transformation needs.
   - **Roles Involved**: Data Engineer, Data Quality Specialist, Data Analyst.

### 3. **Data Mapping and Transformation Design**
   - **Objective**: Define how data from the source system will be transformed and loaded into the target system.
   - **Key Activities**:
     - Creating a mapping document that defines how fields in the source data relate to fields in the target system.
     - Defining data transformation rules (e.g., converting formats, data enrichment, aggregation).
     - Designing data validation and cleansing rules to ensure data quality.
     - Defining relationships, constraints, and indexes for the target schema.
   - **Roles Involved**: Data Architect, Data Migration Specialist, Data Engineer.

### 4. **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Process Development**
   - **Objective**: Implement the process for extracting, transforming, and loading data from source to target systems.
   - **Key Activities**:
     - Developing or configuring ETL tools/scripts to extract data from source systems.
     - Applying transformation rules to clean, filter, and reformat data.
     - Loading transformed data into the target database or system.
     - Testing data flow, performance, and integrity during the ETL process.
   - **Roles Involved**: Data Engineer, ETL Developer, Database Administrator (DBA).

### 5. **Data Cleansing and Validation**
   - **Objective**: Ensure the data being migrated is accurate, complete, and ready for migration.
   - **Key Activities**:
     - Applying cleansing rules to remove duplicates, obsolete data, and correct errors.
     - Standardizing data formats and validating data against business rules.
     - Running data quality checks to ensure accuracy, consistency, and integrity.
     - Documenting cleansing efforts and validation results for audit and compliance.
   - **Roles Involved**: Data Quality Specialist, Data Analyst, Data Engineer.

### 6. **Data Migration Testing**
   - **Objective**: Ensure the migration process works correctly before full execution.
   - **Key Activities**:
     - Conducting unit tests for individual migration components (e.g., ETL scripts).
     - Performing integration testing to validate end-to-end data flow.
     - Conducting dry runs or mock migrations using a subset of data to identify potential issues.
     - Comparing source and target data to ensure consistency and accuracy post-migration.
     - Handling data reconciliation by checking for data loss or corruption.
   - **Roles Involved**: Data Migration Specialist, QA Engineer, Data Engineer.

### 7. **Data Migration Execution**
   - **Objective**: Migrate the data from the legacy system to the target system.
   - **Key Activities**:
     - Executing the planned migration in phases or all at once (depending on the strategy).
     - Monitoring data transfer, handling errors, and logging the process.
     - Performing a post-migration validation to ensure data completeness and accuracy.

     - Setting up ongoing monitoring of the target system's data health.
     - Preparing for potential post-migration issues or corrections.
   - **Roles Involved**: Data Migration Specialist, System Administrator, Data Engineer.

### 10. **Documentation and Knowledge Transfer**
