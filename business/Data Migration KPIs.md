## KPIs for data migration

When defining KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) for your data migration project, especially one as complex as migrating 100 million customers across systems, several factors should be considered to ensure the process is efficient, accurate, and timely. Here are some important KPIs you might want to include:

### 1. **Data Accuracy Rate**
   - **What it measures**: The percentage of data successfully migrated without errors.
   - **Why it's important**: Ensures the quality and integrity of the data post-migration.
   - **Target**: Aim for a very high accuracy rate (typically 99% or higher).

### 2. **Migration Success Rate**
   - **What it measures**: The percentage of records successfully migrated to the new system compared to the total records intended for migration.
   - **Why it's important**: It tracks the completeness of the migration process.
   - **Target**: 100% migration rate is ideal, but track deviations carefully.

### 3. **Data Validation Errors**
   - **What it measures**: The number or percentage of records failing validation checks during or after migration.
   - **Why it's important**: Indicates problems in the transformation logic or data compatibility.
   - **Target**: Minimal validation errors; these should be thoroughly analyzed.

### 4. **Downtime During Migration**
   - **What it measures**: The duration of system downtime caused by the migration process.
   - **Why it's important**: Minimizes disruption to business operations and customer experiences.
   - **Target**: As low as possible, ideally within scheduled maintenance windows.

### 5. **Data Transformation Time**
   - **What it measures**: The amount of time taken to transform data from its legacy format to the target system format.
   - **Why it's important**: Helps identify bottlenecks in the transformation phase.
   - **Target**: Balance speed and accuracy; optimize the process to avoid delays.

### 6. **Performance Impact on Source and Target Systems**
   - **What it measures**: The impact on system performance (e.g., database response times, CPU, memory utilization) during the migration process.
   - **Why it's important**: Avoids significant system slowdowns that could affect other operations.
   - **Target**: Low impact, ideally ensuring that regular operations are minimally affected.

### 7. **Migration Duration (Time to Complete)**
   - **What it measures**: The total time taken to complete the migration of each batch or the entire dataset.
   - **Why it's important**: Helps in planning and managing migration windows effectively.
   - **Target**: Pre-defined according to the migration schedule, with buffer for contingencies.

### 8. **Post-Migration User Acceptance Test (UAT) Results**
   - **What it measures**: The success rate of UATs following migration to ensure functionality in the new system.
   - **Why it's important**: Ensures that migrated data can be used effectively by end users.
   - **Target**: High success rate with minimal issues identified in UAT.

### 9. **Data Reconciliation (Pre- and Post-Migration Data Comparison)**
   - **What it measures**: The comparison of source and target data post-migration to ensure no data was lost or corrupted.
   - **Why it's important**: Ensures completeness and integrity of data.
   - **Target**: 100% reconciliation or minimal acceptable data loss.

### 10. **Cost per Record Migrated**
   - **What it measures**: The cost involved per customer or record migrated.
   - **Why it's important**: Provides insight into the efficiency and financial viability of the migration.
   - **Target**: Minimize cost without compromising quality or speed.

### 11. **Number of Rollbacks or Failed Batches**
   - **What it measures**: The number of times the migration had to be rolled back or the number of batches that failed during migration.
   - **Why it's important**: Indicates process stability and success.
   - **Target**: Minimal rollbacks or batch failures.

### 12. **End-User Satisfaction**
   - **What it measures**: Feedback from users (or customers) regarding system performance and data accuracy post-migration.
   - **Why it's important**: Gauges the real-world impact of the migration.
   - **Target**: High satisfaction levels, reflecting smooth post-migration experiences.

These KPIs will give you a comprehensive view of how well the migration is performing across key dimensions—accuracy, time, performance, and business impact.

## KPIs at the customer level

Given your focus on analyzing KPIs at the customer level in atomic transactions for each target component and after the sanity process, here’s how you might adapt the KPIs to align with your specific requirements:

### **Migration Phase KPIs (Atomic per Customer, per Target Component)**

1. **Customer Migration Success Rate (Per Target Component)**
   - **What it measures**: The percentage of individual customer records successfully migrated to each target component (e.g., different modules or systems).
   - **Why it's important**: Tracks migration success at the granular level, ensuring each component received the intended data correctly.
   - **Focus**: On atomic migration processes and target components like PO, Customer profile, and order history.

2. **Component-Level Transaction Completion Time**
   - **What it measures**: The time taken for the migration of a single customer’s data into each component.
   - **Why it's important**: Helps pinpoint any bottlenecks in specific systems or components.
   - **Focus**: Breakdown of time across various target components to optimize process efficiency.

3. **Atomic Transaction Rollbacks**
   - **What it measures**: The number of atomic transactions (single customer migrations) that had to be rolled back due to errors in individual components.
   - **Why it's important**: Identifies failure points in the process and provides insight into system reliability.
   - **Focus**: Minimize rollbacks per target component.

4. **Component-Specific Data Validation Failures**
   - **What it measures**: The percentage of customer records that fail validation in specific components post-migration.
   - **Why it's important**: Ensures the migrated data is accurate and ready for use.
   - **Focus**: Validation failures in target components like PO or customer data integrity.

### **Post-Sanity Process KPIs**

5. **Qualified Customers for Migration**
   - **What it measures**: The percentage of customers that pass the sanity check and are deemed qualified for migration.
   - **Why it's important**: Ensures only valid and complete customer data is migrated.
   - **Focus**: Identify and track customer eligibility post-sanity checks.

6. **Sanity Process Validation Success Rate**
   - **What it measures**: The number of POs and customers that pass all sanity process validations.
   - **Why it's important**: Ensures readiness of both POs and customer data for migration.
   - **Focus**: Ensure high success rate post-sanity checks to prevent errors during migration.

7. **PO Qualification Rate**
   - **What it measures**: The percentage of Purchase Orders (POs) that are qualified for migration after sanity checks.
   - **Why it's important**: Assesses the completeness and accuracy of POs, ensuring that migration will not fail due to incomplete or inconsistent PO data.
   - **Focus**: Monitor PO readiness for migration to the target system.

8. **Customer and PO Rejection Rate (Post-Sanity)**
   - **What it measures**: The percentage of customers or POs rejected after the sanity process.
   - **Why it's important**: Identifies data issues before migration, helping to fix them before they cause migration failures.
   - **Focus**: Ensure low rejection rate to streamline the migration process.

By focusing on these KPIs, you can closely monitor both the individual customer migration process and the data validation outcomes after the sanity process. This will give you a clearer picture of both transactional integrity and readiness for migration.
